# PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

  In online learning environments such as Byju’s, Khan Academy, Google Meet, or Zoom, teachers cannot easily monitor whether students are attentive, engaged, or experiencing fatigue during classes. Students may lose focus, switch tabs, answer quizzes too quickly, or remain inactive, which affects their learning outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered Online Learning Fatigue Detector that monitors behavioral patterns, including mouse movements, typing speed, quiz and question response times, tab-switching frequency, and interaction levels.

  Using a browser extension, the system analyzes these patterns in real-time to detect signs of fatigue, distraction, or disengagement. Smart notifications are sent to both students and teachers, suggesting breaks or focus adjustments. Additionally, a teacher dashboard provides aggregated insights on class engagement while respecting student privacy. This approach is unique, platform-independent, and helps improve online learning effectiveness by enhancing attention, reducing fatigue, and motivating students.
